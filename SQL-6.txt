// Transaction and auto commit 

** in auto commit mode the query will not be performed until we type COMMIT at the end, if we want to go back (undo) the query
we will type ROLLBACK,

** in MySQL by default auto commit is on, to make it off type SET autocommit = 0;
** and to make it on again type SET autocommit = 1;

// Primary Key

** Difference between Primary Key and Unique --> primary key does not allow null values, while unique allows null values
one table can only have one primary key , a table can have multiple unique
primary key cannot be easily dropped, while unique column can be dropped easily

// Foreign Key

** If we add multiple columns as our data increases the table might become very lag and big, thus we break the table in multiple pieces

1. create a table to store the address of the users and take id as foreign key --> 
CREATE TABLE address (
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	user_id INT,
	street VARCHAR(225),
	city VARCHAR(100),
	state VARCHAR(100),
	pincode VARCHAR(10),
	CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

** (ON DELETE CASCADE) if parent row is deleted it automatically deletes the row in child table as well
** in place of ON DELETE CASCADE we can also use SET NULL or RESTRICT also
